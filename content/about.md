I work at the crossroads of technology and law. On one side, I’ve built a career in IT and cybersecurity; managing systems, digging into network traffic, and homelabbing tech environments to sharpen my technical skills. On the other, I hold an Honours degree in Criminology and the Law from the University of Toronto, where I spent four years studying how rules, institutions, and human behavior shape the world we live in.  

That combination gives me a perspective I rely on every day: cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and logs. It’s about people, accountability, and the legal frameworks that define how technology should be used. My interests go beyond technical defense to the evolving legislation around **cybersecurity, privacy, and artificial intelligence**. I’m especially fascinated by how new laws and standards will shape the way organizations adopt emerging technologies responsibly.

## What I Bring
- A **hands-on technical background** in IT administration, scripting, security monitoring, and digital forensics.  
- A **deep understanding of the law and criminal behavior**, with a focus on risk, compliance, and the societal impacts of technology.  
- A drive to **connect the dots** between legal obligations, business needs, and technical realities.

## Beyond the Resume

I enjoy building projects that let me test new ideas. From setting up a SOC homelab and mapping adversary techniques to MITRE ATT&CK, to analyzing threat reports and translating findings into practical defenses. At the same time, I keep an eye on the broader picture: how AI, data governance, and privacy regulation are changing the expectations for technology professionals.  

Outside of work, I’m the kind of person who likes exploring how systems, technical or legal, fit together; and how they can be improved when they don’t.

## Looking Ahead

I see my path continuing at the overlap of **technology, security, and law**. Whether that’s through defending systems against real-world threats, guiding compliance efforts, or contributing to the discussions around AI governance, my goal is to stay adaptable and keep learning as both technology and law evolve.

If that resonates with you, I’d love to connect.
