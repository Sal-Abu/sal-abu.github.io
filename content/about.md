**Systems Administration · Automation · Infrastructure · Legal Insight · Regulatory Compliance**  

## Who I Am  
I’m **Salahiddin**, though most people just call me **Sal**. I work as a **Systems Administrator** and **Regulatory Compliance Consultant**, with a focus on keeping infrastructure **reliable, secure, and easy to manage**. My background is a little unusual. I studied **computer science**, along with **law and socio-legal studies**. This gave me both the technical skills to work with systems and the analytical skills to think critically about the rules, policies, and people around them.  

That mix shaped the way I work today. I like **breaking down complex problems**, creating **clear processes**, and making sure systems don’t just run, but run in a way people can actually depend on.  

## What I Work On In My Free Time  
- **Homelab experiments** and reproducible infrastructure projects that test and refine real-world IT setups.
- **Writing** about technology, systems thinking, and how organizations adapt to the tools they use.
- Publishing **automation workflows and infrastructure prototypes** on GitHub.  

## Skills and Capabilities  
- **Systems Administration**: servers, VMs, and infrastructure deployment and management.
- **Identity & Access**: **Active Directory**, **Azure AD**, user management, group policies, and VPN configuration. 
- **Cloud & Collaboration**: **SharePoint administration**, **Microsoft 365 services**, and **mobile device management (MDM)**.
- **Automation & Scripting**: **Python**, **shell scripting**, **SQL**, and workflow automation with **Power Automate**.
- **Platform Support**: **Windows** (10, 11), **Debian Linux**, **macOS**, and mobile platforms. 
- **IT Operations**: **ITSM practices**, **incident response**, and clear, usable documentation. 
- **Law & Socio-Legal Skills**: **research**, **policy analysis**, and knowledge of **compliance and governance frameworks**.  

## Selected Work Highlights  

### Infrastructure & Systems  
- Deployed and maintained **servers**, **VMs**, and virtualization platforms  
- Configured **Active Directory**, **Azure AD**, **DNS**, **DHCP**, and file services  
- Managed **SharePoint** environments and integrated **Microsoft 365** tools  
- Applied **patch management**, **backups**, and **recovery testing** to ensure reliability  

### Automation & Efficiency  
- Automated **provisioning** and recurring IT tasks with **scripts and workflows**  
- Standardized **system configurations** to improve consistency and reduce incidents  
- Streamlined **onboarding and offboarding** with **MDM**, **account setup**, and **device management**  

### Monitoring & Support  
- Implemented **monitoring**, **logging**, and **alerting** to track system health  
- Troubleshot **hardware and software** issues across **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**  
- Produced **documentation** and **runbooks** to make support more efficient  

### Governance & Compliance  
- Coordinated **change management** for system upgrades and deployments  
- Ensured compliance with **policies**, **security standards**, and **governance frameworks**  
- Applied legal training to produce **structured, reliable documentation**  

## How I Approach Problems  
1. **Discover**: map technical and organizational requirements  
2. **Design**: create solutions that are efficient and maintainable  
3. **Deploy**: implement using repeatable, tested steps  
4. **Automate**: streamline repetitive workflows  
5. **Observe**: monitor and refine systems over time  
6. **Document**: write processes so others can understand and apply them  

## Current Goals  
- Build stronger expertise in **infrastructure-as-code** and **scalable automation**  
- Turn **homelab projects** into reusable **production-grade templates**  
- Explore and write about the overlap between **technology**, **governance**, and **systems thinking**
