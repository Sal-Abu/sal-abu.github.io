Everyone carries a phone these days. It connects us, entertains us, and helps us work. On the surface, it feels like a miracle tool. But the truth underneath is darker. Phones and modern technology are not just harmful, they are *needlessly* harmful. The way the industry works ensures waste, exploitation, and manipulation. None of it is inevitable. It happens because it makes money.

## The Human Cost of Materials

Every phone starts with raw materials like cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements. These resources don’t come free. Many are mined in places where conflict, child labor, and human rights abuses are widespread. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, industrial cobalt and copper mining has led to forced evictions, unsafe conditions, and severe abuses of human rights. [Amnesty International reports](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/09/drc-cobalt-and-copper-mining-for-batteries-leading-to-human-rights-abuses/) detail how entire communities are displaced and rights violated.  

Government and NGO studies also document forced labor and child labor in cobalt extraction. The U.S. Department of Labor calls cobalt mining in the DRC an area of “forced labor” risk. [Forced Labor in Cobalt Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/DRC-FL-Cobalt-Report-508.pdf) shows that many miners work under dangerous conditions with little protection.  

When you add the churn of yearly upgrades, demand fuels these extractive systems. The human cost is hidden from most users, but it is real and measurable.

## The Consumerist Machine

The suffering does not stop at the mine. Phones are designed to keep us replacing, wasting, and consuming.

- **Planned obsolescence**: Software updates often slow older phones so they feel sluggish or incompatible with new apps.  
- **Marginal improvements**: Producers hype small gains in speed or cameras as if they justify a full replacement.  
- **Built-in waste**: It often makes more profit to sell more devices than to perfect durability or repairability.

Those incentives feed a global waste crisis. According to the *Global E-waste Monitor*, the world generated **62 million tonnes** of electronic waste in 2022, and only about **20 %** of it was formally recycled. That’s billions of dollars in scarce materials sent to landfill or informal recycling while manufacturers push replacement cycles.

This is not innovation. It is churn dressed as progress.

## The Software Trap

If hardware extracts from the earth, software extracts from our minds. Most mainstream apps are engineered to capture attention and monetize behavior. Infinite scrolling, push notifications, algorithmic ranking of content—these are psychological hooks, not neutral features. Even having a smartphone nearby reduces performance on cognitive tasks. these devices are built and tailored to hijack your mind and thoughts. 

Further, behind the engagement lies the real profit: data. Every tap, swipe, pause, and hesitation is tracked, analyzed, and sold. Personal life becomes raw material. This is surveillance capitalism in action.

## Case Study: 2024 Snowflake Data Breaches

In 2024, Snowflake, a major cloud data platform, suffered multiple breaches affecting over 100 of its customers, including prominent organizations. The leaks exposed personal and transactional data, some datasets used for extortion. The cascade of risk showed how vulnerabilities at cloud providers can impact millions often people who never directly interact with those platforms, and the sad thing is, data breaches like this aren't even uncommon.  

That your data might be compromised is not theory. It’s built into the chain of services you use: your name, address, habits, purchase history, even medical or ticket data can be swept up by breach after breach.

## Surveillance Capitalism and Data as Commodity

This is not an accident. The business model used by many big tech platforms depends on turning attention and human behavior into commodities. The term *surveillance capitalism* refers to how companies capture and commodify behavioral data to predict and influence future actions.  

That commodification creates real harms for ordinary people:

- **Manipulated behavior**: Ads or political messages become tailored to bypass rational reflection.  
- **Erosion of privacy**: Location history and metadata can reveal where you live, where you travel, or who you meet.  
- **Dynamic pricing & discrimination**: Your inferred financial status or habits might mean you are charged more or offered different deals.  
- **Fraud, identity theft**: When large datasets leak, personal details are on the black market. Scams, phishing, credit fraud follow.

In this economy, you are not the customer. You are the product.

## Why It Is Needlessly Evil

The worst part is that none of this has to be the norm. Phones could be built to last ten years instead of three. Software could be designed to protect attention and privacy, not break them down. Data could be safeguarded rather than sold.  

The point is not that technology must always be harmful. The point is that it doesn’t have to be this harmful. The suffering, the waste, the surveillance. These are choices made because they pay. And those choices leave the rest of us paying the price.
