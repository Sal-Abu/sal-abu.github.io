                <h1 id="what-is-obsidian">What is Obsidian</h1>
<p>Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management tool that lets you create a fully customized, personal workspace. It’s perfect for students, professionals, and anyone who wants to organize their notes, tasks, and projects efficiently, all while keeping full control of your data.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-its-useful">Why It’s Useful</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keeps information evergreen:</strong> Notes stay relevant because linking them together forms a web of interconnected knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Incredibly customizable:</strong> Every part of Obsidian can be tailored to fit your workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform:</strong> Works seamlessly on both laptops and phones.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin ecosystem:</strong> Add powerful new features and automations through the community plugin system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="installing-obsidian">Installing Obsidian</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian website</a>.</li>
<li>Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).</li>
<li>Install the app using the standard installer for your platform.</li>
<li>On first launch, create a <strong>Vault</strong> (your main folder for notes). You can name it something like <code>Obsidian Desktop</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have the base setup ready.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tailoring-obsidian-to-your-use-case">Tailoring Obsidian to Your Use Case</h2>
<p>This setup is designed to be <strong>command palette based</strong>, meaning most actions can be triggered by keyboard shortcuts or quick commands instead of menus. This keeps your workflow fast and efficient.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-plugins">Recommended Plugins</h3>
<p>Below are the plugins that make this setup powerful and flexible. You can install these under <strong>Settings → Community Plugins → Browse</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homepage:</strong> Opens a specific page when you launch Obsidian.</li>
<li><strong>Dataview:</strong> Displays data from notes dynamically (great for project and task tracking).</li>
<li><strong>Excalidraw:</strong> Lets you create drawings, flowcharts, and whiteboard-style diagrams.</li>
<li><strong>Omnisearch:</strong> Improves the search function with fast, fuzzy results.</li>
<li><strong>Templater:</strong> Automates repetitive note creation with pre-made templates.</li>
<li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Adds powerful task management features with due dates and queries.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Switcher++:</strong> Enhances note switching with additional filtering and preview capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-notebase">Setting Up The Notebase</h2>
<p>This project setup transforms Obsidian into a lightweight personal notebase with automatic task tracking and easy access to your most important notes.</p>
<h3 id="1-project-tracker-with-dataview">1. Project Tracker with Dataview</h3>
<p>You’ll use Dataview to display all tasks and notes in one central dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br>
Whenever you create a task in any note (using the <code>- [ ]</code> syntax), it should automatically appear on your homepage in a table view.</p>
<p><strong>Example Dataview Query:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-dataview" data-lang="dataview">table file.link as &#34;Note&#34;, status, priority, due
from &#34;Projects&#34;
where contains(file.folder, &#34;Projects&#34;)
sort due asc
</code></pre><p>This shows all tasks within your “Projects” folder, sorted by due date. You can customize it to include tags, completion status, or file metadata.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-automatic-note-sorting-by-tags">2. Automatic Note Sorting by Tags</h3>
<p>To keep your vault organized, add consistent tags like #project, #idea, or #reference. You can later use Dataview to sort and filter notes automatically.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>table file.link as &#34;Note&#34;, tags
where contains(tags, &#34;project&#34;)
sort file.name asc
</code></pre><p>This ensures all notes tagged with “project” are easily viewable and grouped.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-ephemeral-notes">3. Ephemeral Notes</h3>
<p>Create a folder named Ephemeral for short-lived notes such as daily logs, reminders, or ideas. You can feature these notes on your homepage using a Dataview query like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>table file.link as &#34;Recent Notes&#34;, file.mtime as &#34;Last Edited&#34;
from &#34;Ephemeral&#34;
sort file.mtime desc
limit 5
</code></pre><p>This keeps your most recent or temporary notes easily accessible on your dashboard.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="backing-up-your-notes-with-clound-sync">Backing Up Your Notes With Clound Sync</h3>
<p>One of the best parts of Obsidian is that your notes are stored as plain Markdown files on your computer. You can easily back them up using:</p>
<p>Use Obsidian Sync (paid) or third-party tools like Dropbox, Google Drive, or Syncthing.</p>
<p>Simply point your sync folder to your vault to keep everything automatically backed up.</p>
<h5 id="example-setting-up-free-sync-with-google-drive">Example: Setting Up Free Sync With Google Drive</h5>
<p>Google Drive (Example)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Google Drive for Desktop from <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download">https://www.google.com/drive/download</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once installed and configured, a Google Drive folder will appear on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move your Obsidian vault folder into that Google Drive folder. For example: Google Drive/Obsidian/Student Notebase/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Drive will automatically upload and sync your notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On your phone, install both Google Drive and Obsidian from the app store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Obsidian app, and choose “Open Folder as Vault.” Navigate to the same folder inside Google Drive on your phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now your notes are backed up and stay the same on both devices. You can do the same with Dropbox or OneDrive if you prefer those.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This setup gives you a powerful, self-contained workspace that:</p>
<p>Tracks all your projects and tasks automatically.</p>
<p>Keeps your notes organized and interconnected.</p>
<p>Adapts to your workflow through plugins.</p>
<p>Works across devices with cloud or Git syncing.</p>
<p>Whether you’re using it for school, personal projects, or creative writing, Obsidian can become the digital brain that ties everything together.</p>
